		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Alright, so in <a title="Introducing: Agni" href="http://bayley.green-gaillard.com/blog/?p=5">my last post</a> I managed to figure out what, exactly, Agni <em>is</em>. Now the next most pressing question is: How the heck do I get inside it? I&#8217;ve got the<a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fdownloads%2Fjp%2Fproducts%2Foptix%2FOptiPlex_740_TechSpecs_070326.pdf"> tech specs</a> now, so I&#8217;m fairly confident what I expect to see once I do get in, but a cursory inspection reveals no screws of any kind. Stupid hidden screw techniques.</p>
<p>My husband managed to figure it out though:</p>
<p><a href="http://yamikuronue.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-26-08-42-27.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1475" src="http://yamikuronue.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-26-08-42-27.jpg?w=640" alt="2013-02-26 08.42.27" width="640" height="360" /></a>That little piece with the lock slides to one side, causing the entire side panel to pop off. Voila! And we&#8217;re inside!</p>
<p><a href="http://yamikuronue.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-26-08-43-46.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1476" src="http://yamikuronue.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-26-08-43-46.jpg?w=640" alt="2013-02-26 08.43.46" width="640" height="360" /></a>It&#8217;s nice and compact, though I like my cases roomier so I can add to them. Definitely not going to be able to fit multiple drives in there. Of note, there does appear to be an optical drive that I&#8217;d missed in my earlier rundown (they don&#8217;t come with one by default I guess), and&#8230; snicker&#8230; there&#8217;s a 3.5&#8243; floppy drive&#8230; lol.  Nice labeling on the cables though.</p>
<p>My first goal was to simply swap out the hard drive with the one I had on hand, already set up for web serving. Notice the tight space though: clearly you can&#8217;t slide the drive out of the bay like you would in a larger tower, not without removing the power supply. So how do you&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="http://yamikuronue.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-26-08-45-05.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1477" src="http://yamikuronue.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-26-08-45-05.jpg?w=640" alt="2013-02-26 08.45.05" width="640" height="360" /></a>Oh! Those blue clips, when pressed together, cause the entire bay to undock, letting you lift the bay out and then swap the drive. Very clever, Dell. Very clever indeed.</p>
<p>(At work we have a system which actually has a bay open to the exterior of the machine, letting you simply flip some clips to disengaged and slide the drive entirely out without opening the case. I love that system. This is nice too though!)</p>
<p><a href="http://yamikuronue.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-26-08-46-17.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1478" src="http://yamikuronue.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-26-08-46-17.jpg?w=640" alt="2013-02-26 08.46.17" width="640" height="360" /></a>Alright, now to slide the smaller but already configured drive in and&#8230;. uh-oh. Problem.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1474" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1474" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://yamikuronue.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-26-08-47-32.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1474" src="http://yamikuronue.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/2013-02-26-08-47-32.jpg?w=360" alt="2013-02-26 08.47.32" width="360" height="640" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1474" class="wp-caption-text">Old drive on left, new on right</figcaption></figure>
<p>The old drive is&#8230; IDE, and the new is SATA. (The specs said something about slimline, but this doesn&#8217;t look slimeline, so I&#8217;m going to go with normal SATA) I clearly need an adapter  Unless&#8230;.. I do have other machines in the house&#8230; and while transfer via ethernet takes for friggan EVER, it is feasible. Hmm&#8230;. I&#8217;ll have to ponder this further.</p>
