		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In <a title="CI with Jenkins for Javascript: Part 1: Unit Testing" href="/blog/posts/2014-11a-jenkinspt1">Part One</a>, we set up a Jenkins server and some unit testing. In <a title="CI with Jenkins for Javascript: Part 2: Static Analysis" href="/blog/posts/2014-11b-jenkinspt2/">Part Two</a>, we added some static analysis tools to our build. But we&#8217;re still manually running all this, even if it&#8217;s all tied together now. Let&#8217;s talk about some of the features Jenkins brings to the table.</p>
<h2>Building automatically</h2>
<p>Our code release pipeline is going through some revisions to make better use of branching, so I have the good fortune of being able to detail for you two different build strategies for two different types of branching strategies. Today I will detail our old style, and in a future post, I will detail the updates we did to make a more branch-heavy system work.</p>
<p>Our original strategy involved a branch for each codebase representing our demo environment; to promote a project to demo, the code would be merged into the demo branch using Subversion. This is the easier strategy to set up,  because you always know where in the repository to point Jenkins.</p>
<p>The first change we made was to symlink the location our repo was checked out by  Jenkins to a network share on a demo server. This allows Jenkins to check out the code directly to the server, where it can then run the unit tests. That was the simplest way for us to get the code onto our servers, but there are many ways you can go about this step, including using FTP or SSH to update the server; if you have many servers you want Jenkins to update, that&#8217;s probably the best way to do it. We used a symlink because it plays nicely with Jenkins&#8217; preferred build pipeline: First it checks out the code, then it runs the tests, then it would deploy to other servers. Our code does not need to be compiled before being deployed, and Jenkins was not running on a machine configured to run as a Coldfusion server, so by checking out the code directly onto a server, we had it up and running as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve figured out your deployment strategy, you&#8217;re ready to trigger Jenkins to automatically build based on code promotion. There are two strategies to accomplish this task: polling and a post-commit hook. Polling is the easiest to set up; there&#8217;s literally a checkbox under &#8220;Build Triggers&#8221; called &#8220;Poll SCM&#8221;. This allows you to set up a poll strategy usinga similar syntax as the one used to configure cronjobs; for example, to poll every fifteen minutes, you use the string &#8220;H/15 * * * *&#8221;. This can be configured without ever leaving Jenkins, and it will only build when there&#8217;s new changes.</p>
<p>Post-commit hooks require some work in Subversion. With this strategy, you configure Subversion to activate Jenkins whenever a commit is pushed. I didn&#8217;t do this myself, but there&#8217;s some details in the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Subversion+Plugin">subversion plugin notes</a> about how you might set this up. Honestly, the more I read about it, the less interesting it looked. Polling every ten minutes or so would achieve the same level of detail for my organization; remember, I&#8217;m talking about major code promotions to demo that happen probably no more often than once a day.</p>

<h2>Information Radiators</h2>
<p>So, you have your Jenkins server pointed to your repo. It&#8217;s polling every fifteen minutes, and it reports out on the unit tests, linting results, and code complexity. You&#8217;re feeling pretty proud of yourself: this is a nice spiffy setup, capable of giving a good sense of the long-term health of the project.</p>
<p>Too bad nobody looks at it.</p>
<p>Oh sure, you can give them the dashboard link. Maybe one or two of them will poke at it every week or so. For a while. Until they get bored and wander off. IT people are humans too, and humans are notoriously averse to reading anything or seeking out information on their own. How can you make the information more in-their-face?</p>
<p>One answer is to present the information in a pretty easily-understood graph or chart and display that on a monitor in the hallway. As people walk past it, the information is thrust into their face, and they tend to stop and take a look at it. The nicer the visualization, the more likely people will stop to look at it and accidentally ingest the information you&#8217;re trying to get across ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Jenkins has a lovely API for retrieving information about a build: on any page, add &#8220;/api&#8221; to the end. If you just add /api, it gives you a description of the formats you can retrieve the api information in; to get the JSON data, you add /api/json to any page. For human-readability, add &#8220;?pretty=true&#8221;. You can also get the data in xml format using the same method.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I wrote a quick javascript app that polls Jenkins for data about unit tests using Backbone to abstract away all the details. The model is something like:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="js">var TestResult = Backbone.Model.extend({
    baseURL: "",
    build: "lastCompletedBuild",
    url: function() {
        return this.baseURL + "/job/" +  this.id + "/" + this.build + "/testReport/api/json?jsonp=?";
    }
});</pre>
<p>And the view something like:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="js">var PlatformView = Backbone.View.extend({
    initialize: function(options) {
        this.options = options;
        this.model.on("change", this.render, this);
        this.model.on("error", this.renderErrorState, this)
    },
    render: function() {
        var tpl = Handlebars.compile($("#platformTemplate").html());
        var data = this.model.toJSON();
        var ts = new Date(this.options.timestamp);
        data.timestamp = ts.getMonth() + 1 + "-" + ts.getDate() + "-" + ts.getFullYear() + " " + ts.getHours() + ":" + (ts.getMinutes() &lt; 10 ? "0" : "") + ts.getMinutes();
        var html = tpl(data);
        $(this.el).html(html);

        var model_id = this.model.get("id");
        var chartdata = [
                {label: "Pass", value: this.model.get("passCount")},
                {label: "Fail", value: this.model.get("failCount")},
                {label: "Skip", value: this.model.get("skipCount")}
            ];
        testResultsPieChart.drawTestResultsGraph(chartdata,"#" + model_id + "-chart");
        return this;
    },
    renderErrorState : function() {
        var tpl = Handlebars.compile($("#errorTemplate").html());
        var data = this.model.toJSON();
        var html = tpl(data);
        $(this.el).html(html);

        var model_id = this.model.get("id");
        var chartdata = [
                {label: "Pass", value: 0},
                {label: "Fail", value: 1},
                {label: "Skip", value: 0}
            ];
        testResultsPieChart.drawTestResultsGraph(chartdata,"#" + model_id + "-chart");
    }
});</pre>
<p>Where testResultsPieChart uses the d3 library to convert the data into a pie chart. I tossed all this into a basic Bootstrap page, because I&#8217;m not much of a designer ðŸ™‚ The result ends up looking like:</p>
<figure id="attachment_77" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77" style="width: 761px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="/blog/jenkins_radiator.png"><img class="wp-image-77" src="/blog/jenkins_radiator.png" alt="jenkins_radiator" width="761" height="573" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-77" class="wp-caption-text">Note that one project had managed to break their test runner while I was taking this screenshot. You&#8217;ll see that result if qUnit never finishes executing.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where I&#8217;d gotten when someone told me we were changing branching strategy to remove the idea of a single demo branch ðŸ˜€ Moving goalposts keeps life interesting.</p>
