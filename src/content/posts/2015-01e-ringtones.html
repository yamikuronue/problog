		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This was frustrating enough that I wanted to document it, as it&#8217;s surprisingly complicated. Let&#8217;s say you have a sound file on your computer &#8212; maybe a baby laughing that you want to set for the baby&#8217;s mom&#8217;s ringtone, or something like that. Legally recorded MP3 files, let&#8217;s assume, for the purposes of demonstration.</p>
<p>How can you go from &#8220;file on my computer&#8221; to &#8220;ringtone for a contact on my phone&#8221; with Android Kit-Kat?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 1: File onto phone</h2>
<p>The easiest way I found to get the file onto my phone was to download the Dropbox app (which I already use for getting photos off my phone and onto my computer) and uploading the file to my dropbox. Done. It&#8217;s on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 2: File into Ringtone</h2>
<p>This was the part that was so bloody complicated. It&#8217;s actually simple once you know the secret. You&#8217;re going to go to the file in the dropbox app and tap the little down arrow next to it. Then click &#8220;more&#8221; in the popup, then &#8220;Export&#8221; from the menu. This means &#8220;export the file out of Dropbox&#8217;s cloud storage onto a local file in my phone where other apps can see it&#8221;, basically.</p>
<p>You may be asked to select an app. If so, click &#8220;Save to device&#8221;.</p>
<p>You probably have a screen like this:</p>

<p>SUPER NOT HELPFUL, GOOGLE.</p>
<p>Recent and Downloads seem to offer no clues:</p>

<p>The key is to click the menu option in the upper-right corner:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CHECK THAT BOX.</p>
<p>Now you have a new option:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-V2jIQ8UAj50/VLlA45uiltI/AAAAAAAABtI/gdBYGsd01Bc/w361-h642-no/2015-01-16.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="642" /></p>
<p>Navigate to internal storage -&gt; Ringtones and save it there. PROBLEM SOLVED.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 3: Ringtone to contact</h2>
<p>This is also stupid complicated. Basic rule: Don&#8217;t click the phone icon. I know you go there when you want to call someone, and you can edit their number from there. Don&#8217;t do it. Even if you click &#8220;All contacts&#8221;, you&#8217;re not actually looking at your contacts, you&#8217;re in the wrong app. Just stay away from the blue phone icon.</p>
<p>Instead you want to open the &#8220;People&#8221; app. Why is it &#8220;People&#8221; and not &#8220;Contacts&#8221;, who knows, it used to be Contacts but now it&#8217;s People. Anyway. Then find your contact, open the menu, and click &#8220;Set ringtone&#8221;. Your file should be in the list. Voila! Ringtone set.</p>
