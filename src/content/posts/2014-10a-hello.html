		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my new tech blog. I&#8217;ve previously blogged about technical issues rarely on my personal blog, but since there&#8217;s really a different audience for that stuff as opposed to my costuming, writing, and personal updates, I figured I&#8217;d break it out into a new wordpress install and link it to my resume. Which means&#8230; for the first time, I&#8217;m blogging under my <strong>real name</strong>!</p>
<p>So, welcome! I&#8217;ve transferred over the most interesting of my tech blog posts from my other blog so that there&#8217;s something to read about. I&#8217;ll be blogging things sporadically, starting with a feature from work about how to get a decent functional test automation framework written from scratch with Java and Selenium Webdriver, and then probably lots of crap about my various github projects until I find something more interesting to write about.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you!</p>
