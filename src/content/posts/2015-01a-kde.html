title: "Quick Tip: KDE For Windows looking bad"

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For most of you, the takeaway from this Quick Tip will probably be &#8220;You can run KDE applications on Windows?&#8221;. To which I say, yes! Check out <a href="https://windows.kde.org/">https://windows.kde.org/</a> if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>For the un-linux-savvy, KDE is a desktop environment for Linux; I personally have been using Konversation as my IRC client ever since I was stuck with Kubuntu for a few years as my primary operating system due to an issue with a busted Windows install disk. I just like it better than MIRC, you know? So when I reformatted my hard drive and Konversation looked like this:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/KonversationOnWindows_edited.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-84" src="/blog/KonversationOnWindows_edited.png" alt="KonversationOnWindows_edited" width="818" height="436" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/KonversationOnWindows_fixed.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-85" src="/blog/KonversationOnWindows_fixed.png" alt="KonversationOnWindows_fixed" width="953" height="508" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was perplexed. What had I done wrong? Where were my pretty rounded corners? Why did it look like a nostalgia trip to the Windows NT era?</p>
<p>The answer is simple; so simple, in fact, that I had to ask user Xiluembo on the freenode IRC support chat for KDE Windows the answer. The package &#8220;kde-workspace&#8221; contains the default Oxygen theme for KDE, which I was used to Konversation using. No idea why it didn&#8217;t default to aero like everything ought to, but that was a real quick fix to what had become a vexing problem by the time I stumbled into the chat. Thanks for the tip, Xiluembo!</p>
